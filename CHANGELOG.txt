    flutter is so much better than kivy holy shit
    chat works but no chatgpt
    home screen and chat screen drawer works
    made theme black + orange
        wait isn't this pornhub's color theme

    added "profile icon" to messages

    split home and chat screen into seperate .dart files
    chatgpt integration via chat_gpt_sdk package

    chatgpt works and can respond
        need to hide api key, use custom fine tuned model instead of just gpt4, give it the proper prompts, and just generally add more features like image understanding
    yeah so far loving flutter
        hot reload is so useful
    
    even added a temporary "Typing..." message and async for the chatgpt messages
        need error handling though
    
    shortcut for sending message (shift + enter), and some helpful tooltips
    also a tooltip for the exact time sent
    improved textfield by adding min and max lines

    app now uses fine tuned model of 4o-mini from previous work in python
    made service account + api key to get off personal account

    drawer is now located on a main screen instead of in each .dart file for home and chat screen
    persistant screens now work fully (doesn't make a new screen every drawer click) using index stacks

    added debounce for drawer listtiles and chatgpt send button
11/23/24
    got git/github vsc support working finally
    new idea for app:
        renamed app to therapup (support and feedback from melinda)
        instead of just having like a cold messaging chatbot app, you can talk to a pet (dog) about your feelings
        need to update theme, chat screen, etc.
        need animations and assets for dog character
        virtual pet customization ?!
    TODO:
        fine tune gpt model for new usecase with a 'doggier' personality
        update theme
        find how to animate in flutter
